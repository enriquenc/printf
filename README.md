# ft_printf

Regardless of the programming language considered, the printf function,(or its equivalents)
is always highly useful. The main reason is the ease of its formatting, and the
support of diverse types in variable numbers. Some variations even propose to be able to
write the resulting string of characters either in a file descriptor or in a particular stream.
Some also propose to recall this string without printing it. In short, undeniably, printf
is a vital function.

I recoded this function, using my libft (https://github.com/enriquenc/libft).

Managed the following conversions: sSpdDioOuUxXcC.

Managed %%.

Managed flags #0-+ and space.

Managed the minimum field-width.

Managed the precision.

Managed the flags hh, h, l, ll, j, and z.
